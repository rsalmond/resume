__Profile__ of a problem solver.

I am a skilled technologist with experience in software, internet technologies, and network administration. I bring depth and breadth of understanding to my work and have a knack for devising creative solutions using anything from industry standard tools to finding a use for whatever is on hand.

The advantage I rely on to achieve results is systems analysis. I am interested in how software works, but I am fascinated by how individual components fit together in complex ways.

My approach to success begins with familiarizing myself with the internals of systems I work with and using that to my advantage while clearly communicating my findings. I excel in problem resolution roles and do my best work when no one is sure exactly how to proceed.
